This repository will show if a secret is read from a Forked PR

Some update.

Is the environment variable going to write from a fork pr?

Secret redacted. Trying a json object.

Adding this line to produce a pull request. 

## PR's

PR's, when submitted do fire-off the CI, though no secrets are read. This is expected process. The question I have is what is the correct process to test that PR, i.e. run in through the CI as me. Of course after vetting the code.
